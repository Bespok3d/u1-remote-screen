# Contributing

Thanks for working on a Bespok3d plugin. Bespok3d is a printer-agnostic plugin manager for Klipper
printers that runs on stock firmware, with no custom-firmware flashing. This repo publishes one or
more plugins as signed `.b3` packages that the desktop app installs onto a printer through the
on-printer daemon. See [README.md](README.md) for this repo's layout, build, and release mechanics.

## Before you write code

Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). It is the contract for changes here: the plugin model (a plugin declares
WHAT the printer should end up with, never a script that runs on the printer), the non-negotiables
(RULE ZERO: no em-dash or en-dash; every identifier carries domain meaning; nesting beyond one level
is suspicious; rule of three; extend upstream additively; never commit a real secret or LAN value),
and the working procedure. If you use an AI assistant (many contributors do), point it at that file;
`AGENTS.md` sends non-Claude tools there too.

## Quick start: from clone to pull request

Six steps. A change is ready for review when all six are done and the gate is green.

### 1. Install the tools

| Tool | Why | macOS | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| git 2.23 or newer | `git switch` and cloning submodules in one pass | preinstalled, or `brew install git` | `sudo apt install git` |
| Python 3.11 | the printer's runtime; the gate pins it and refuses to run on another version | `brew install python@3.11`, or `brew install uv` | install `uv` (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh`) and the gate provisions 3.11 itself |
| Node 20 or newer | runs the shared detectors (the em-dash guard, workflow pinning) | `brew install node` | `nvm install 20`; distro packages are usually older than 20 |
| shellcheck | lints this repo's shell scripts | `brew install shellcheck` | `sudo apt install shellcheck` |
| GitHub CLI (optional) | opens the pull request from the terminal | `brew install gh` | see [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) |

You also need an SSH key on your GitHub account (`ssh -T git@github.com` should greet you by name) and
access to the Bespok3d org: these repos are private during the beta, so ask the maintainer to add you
before you clone.

The gate builds its own Python tool venv under `lib_bespok3d/tooling/` the first time you run it.
Nothing is installed into your system Python.

### 2. Clone with the submodule

`lib_bespok3d` carries the shared gate helpers and the workspace detectors, and nothing in this repo
checks out green without it. Changes are made on `dev`, so clone that branch:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch dev git@github.com:Bespok3d/u1-remote-screen.git
cd u1-remote-screen
```

Already cloned, or seeing `lib_bespok3d/tooling/gate-lib.sh: No such file or directory`? Run this
once from the repo root:

```sh
git submodule sync --recursive && git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The `sync` half matters on an existing clone: it repoints the submodule at the relative URL, so the
submodule is fetched over whatever protocol you cloned this repo with. Without it, a clone made over
SSH still tries to fetch the submodule over HTTPS and stops at a `Username for 'https://github.com':`
prompt.

### 3. Branch off `dev`

```sh
git switch dev && git pull
git switch -c <short-name-for-your-change>
```

### 4. Make the change

Only what your user story needs. Keep the plugin's `doc/README.md` and `doc/CHANGELOG.md` current when
behavior or config changes, and add a regression test where the repo has a test layer for it. The rules
the reviewer applies are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), and RULE ZERO (no em-dash, no en-dash) covers your
commit message too.

### 5. Run the gate until it is green

```sh
bash scripts/check.sh
```

It runs the shared workspace detectors (the em-dash guard, workflow pinning, shellcheck) plus whatever
language layer the plugin ships (ruff, mypy and pytest for a plugin that carries Python). On a failure,
fix the cause. If a detector is genuinely wrong about one line, justify that one line at the smell
(`# gate-allow <metric>: <reason>`); never mute a check to make a number go down.

### 6. Commit, push and open the pull request

```sh
git commit -am "<what changed and why>"
git push -u origin <your-branch>
gh pr create --base dev --fill      # or open the link that git push prints
```

The pull request targets `dev`. CI runs this same `scripts/check.sh` on it, so a red gate is not
reviewable and blocks the release.

## Release

Bump a plugin's `manifest.json` `version`. On merge, the `b3-builder` CI Action packs the `.b3`,
signs it, cuts a release, and registers it in the org index. Do not hand-edit `index.json`, the
`.atom.json`, `index.json.sig`, or anything under `dist/`: those are generated and signed by CI.

A version bump also changes what the desktop app bundles offline, and the app keeps a committed
snapshot of that bundle. Once your manifest change is in, run `npm run golden:refresh` in the
`Bespok3d-desktop` checkout and commit the refreshed snapshot with it: the app's gate stays red
until someone does.

## What a good change looks like

- Scoped to a clear user story; only what the story needs.
- Follows the rules in CLAUDE.md; passes the gate green.
- Ships a regression test where the repo has a test layer for the behavior, in the same change.
- Keeps the plugin's `doc/README.md` and `doc/CHANGELOG.md` current when it changes behavior or config.

## Constraints

- The maintainer owns git history and releases; submit changes as a pull request against `dev`.
- Never SSH-mutate or reconfigure a live printer without explicit authorization; a serial port on a
  printer may be a live Klipper MCU link. Read-only diagnosis is fine.

## Signing off your work

Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` line. It is your statement that you wrote the change, or
that you otherwise have the right to contribute it, under the terms of the Developer Certificate of
Origin (<https://developercertificate.org/>). Git writes the line for you:

```sh
git commit -s -m "your message"
```

A pull request whose commits are not signed off cannot be merged.
