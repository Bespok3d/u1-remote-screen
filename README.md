A solo Bespok3d plugin repo: it ships one plugin (`remote-screen`) and publishes a single index atom into `Bespok3d/main-index/atoms/`.

## Layout

```text
u1-remote-screen/
  remote-screen/                  # the plugin; its dir name is the manifest .name
    manifest.json
    files/              # payload the daemon places on the printer
    doc/README.md       # rendered in-app; not deployed
  .github/workflows/release.yml
  dist/                 # build output (gitignored)
```

The plugin declares WHAT (destination classes + restart hooks), never paths or raw commands; the
printer-side adapter realizes it.

## Build locally

Needs Node.js 20+. Builds run through the shared `Bespok3d/b3-builder` tool:

```sh
npm install github:Bespok3d/b3-builder
npx b3-builder build --source ./remote-screen --atom-repo Bespok3d/u1-remote-screen
# -> dist/remote-screen-<ver>.b3 + dist/remote-screen.atom.json
```

## Releasing

Bump `remote-screen/manifest.json` `version` and push the tag `plugin-<name>-v<version>` naming that
plugin and that exact number. A push to `main` publishes nothing, and the run is refused if the tag
and the manifest disagree. CI runs the `Bespok3d/b3-builder` Action, which packs the `.b3` and cuts
a release; the `register-atoms` action from `Bespok3d/main-index` then registers the atom. This repo
contributes atoms only and publishes no list of its own. Secrets: `MAIN_INDEX_TOKEN` (contents:write
on main-index) and `REGISTRY_SIGNING_KEY` (the org registry key the `b3-builder` Action signs each
`.b3` and atom with).

## Maintainership

These plugins are published and maintained by the Bespok3d org, and several of them repackage or
build on upstream source material. If you own the source material a plugin is based on and would
rather manage it yourself, you are welcome to contact the org to claim it back. The one condition is
that it stays actively maintained: a claimed plugin left to rot will be reclaimed so users are never
stranded on an abandoned package.

choice, so that nobody has to work out which file carries which terms. Version 3 of the GPL and
version 3 of the AGPL may be combined in a single work, and section 13 of each licence says so; what
cannot happen is code offered under version 3 of the GPL alone being re-offered under the AGPL.
